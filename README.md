As our notebook got bigger, it was taking a long time to load and we also encountered merge conflict issues a couple of times, so we split up the workings into a couple of notebooks.

- The main one to look at will be Data Analysis - final.ipynb and NeuralNetwork.ipynb
- For the Exploratory Data Analysis, please refer to EDA.ipynb
